# RF12_Stream

Arduino library to provide a software emulation of a transparent
serial link using the HopeRF RFM12B transceiver modules. The library
extends the Arduino stream class so the user is able to access the
RFM12B as a serial device in much the same way as the Arduino
environment enables access to the hardware UART(s).
